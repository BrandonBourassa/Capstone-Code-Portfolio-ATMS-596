# Capstone-Code-Portfolio-ATMS-596
This repository contains the data and code for analyzing historical trends in Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) along the U.S. West Coast. The research focuses on identifying changes in AR frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution from 1950 to 2018, using the Gershunov AR Catalog.

Contents:
ARcatalog_NCEP_NEW_1948-2018_Comprehensive_FINAL_29JAN18.csv: The Atmospheric River (AR) catalog containing key variables such as AR ID, date, coastal latitude and longitude of landfall, integrated vapor transport (IVT), and wind components. This dataset forms the basis of the analysis.

Capstone_Project_Bourassa.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that includes the Python code for:

Preprocessing the AR catalog.
Performing statistical analyses to identify temporal and spatial trends.
Visualizing the trends in AR frequency, intensity, and distribution over time.
Requirements
To run the analysis, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

-xarray
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-scipy
